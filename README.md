## Customization:
Cyberpunk has almost every line of code with a description making it easy and user-friendly to edit to your preference!

> The Theme does disable light mode and dark mode and applies the same properties to both of them, only found issue is in the GIF selection it still appears white.
> Temporary resolution: Switch from light mode to dark mode.
